# Non-Functional Requirements

## 1. Performance
*   NFR1.1: (POC Target) The system should respond to user messages within 3-5 seconds for typical interactions.
*   NFR1.2: (Post-POC) The system must be able to handle X concurrent users/conversations without significant degradation (specific X to be defined based on initial AWS sizing and Bedrock limits).

## 2. Scalability
*   NFR2.1: The architecture (AWS services, Bedrock) must be designed to allow for horizontal scaling to accommodate a growing number of business accounts and end-user traffic.
*   NFR2.2: Adding new domain agents or knowledge bases should not disproportionately impact the performance of existing functionalities.

## 3. Reliability & Availability
*   NFR3.1: (POC Target) The core messaging and agent interaction functionalities should be available during business hours.
*   NFR3.2: (Post-POC) The system should aim for 99.9% uptime for critical components once fully deployed.
*   NFR3.3: The system should have mechanisms for graceful degradation if a non-critical component (e.g., a specific 3rd party API) is temporarily unavailable.

## 4. Security
*   NFR4.1: All sensitive data, including WhatsApp Business API keys and user data, must be stored securely (e.g., using AWS KMS, Secrets Manager).
*   NFR4.2: Communication between components should be encrypted (e.g., HTTPS).
*   NFR4.3: (Phase 3) Implement WAF to protect against common web exploits.
*   NFR4.4: (Phase 3) Ensure the system design and data handling processes are aligned with GDPR principles for businesses operating in relevant jurisdictions.
*   NFR4.5: Access to administrative functions and sensitive configurations must be restricted and logged.

## 5. Usability (for Businesses configuring the system - Post-POC)
*   NFR5.1: (Future) The interface for businesses to register accounts and manage basic agent settings should be intuitive and require minimal training.

## 6. Maintainability
*   NFR6.1: The codebase should be well-documented and follow consistent coding standards.
*   NFR6.2: The system should be designed in a modular way to facilitate easier updates and bug fixes.
*   NFR6.3: (Phase 4) CI/CD pipeline should automate testing and deployment processes.

## 7. Data Management
*   NFR7.1: The system must handle user data (conversations, provided documents/images) in a way that respects privacy.
*   NFR7.2: (Phase 2) Redis caching should be implemented to improve response times and reduce load on backend systems.

## 8. Accuracy (AI Agents)
*   NFR8.1: (POC Target) Agents should provide relevant and contextually appropriate responses for a defined set of test scenarios.
*   NFR8.2: (Phase 3) Implement mechanisms for testing and evaluating agent accuracy, with a target of X% accuracy for common queries (X to be defined).
