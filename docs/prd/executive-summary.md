# Executive Summary

This document outlines the Product Requirements for a new project to develop a scalable multiagent interface on WhatsApp. The system will enable companies to register their WhatsApp Business accounts and leverage a sophisticated AI-powered platform. This platform will utilize knowledge bases, third-party APIs, AI agents, predefined flows, and guardrails to create a supervisor agent and multiple domain-specific agents (e.g., for different departments or services within a company).

The core innovation lies in replacing convoluted nested menu functions with a natural, conversational AI. This AI will be capable of asking clarifying questions to gather necessary information, intelligently selecting the appropriate tools or agents to fulfill user requests, converting voice notes to text, and processing images or documents provided by users. The ultimate aim is to ensure reliable, secure, and seamless customer engagement.

The project is planned in four phases, with a Proof of Concept (POC) targeted for completion by the end of September.
