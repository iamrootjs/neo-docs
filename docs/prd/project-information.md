# Project Information

## Project Name

WhatsApp Multiagent System

## Project Description

This project aims to build a scalable multiagent interface on WhatsApp. It allows companies to register their WhatsApp Business accounts and utilize a system of AI agents (a supervisor agent and multiple domain-specific agents) for customer interaction. The system will leverage knowledge bases, third-party APIs, predefined flows, and guardrails to provide natural, conversational AI experiences. Key features include the ability to understand and process user requests, ask clarifying questions, convert voice notes to text, and handle images/documents. The goal is to deliver reliable, secure, and seamless customer engagement.

## Project POC Deadline

End of September.
