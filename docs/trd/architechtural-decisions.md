# Architectural Decisions

This document records the key architectural decisions made for the WhatsApp Multiagent System, along with their justifications and trade-offs, particularly for the Proof of Concept (POC).

## 1. Cloud Platform: AWS Exclusively
*   **Decision:** Utilize Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the sole cloud provider for all infrastructure and managed services.
*   **Justification:**
    *   Rich set of managed services relevant to the project (Bedrock, Lambda, API Gateway, S3, RDS/DynamoDB, Transcribe, ElastiCache).
    *   Amazon Bedrock is a core requirement for leveraging foundation models and building AI agents.
    *   Scalability, reliability, and security features offered by AWS.
    *   Familiarity within the team (assumption, can be adjusted).
*   **Trade-offs:** Vendor lock-in with AWS. Costs associated with AWS services (though managed services and serverless can be cost-effective at POC scale).

## 2. Primary AI Service: Amazon Bedrock Agents
*   **Decision:** Use Amazon Bedrock Agents as the primary mechanism for implementing both the Supervisor Agent and Domain Agents.
*   **Justification:**
    *   Simplifies development of generative AI applications by providing managed capabilities for prompt engineering, knowledge base integration (RAG), and action/tool invocation.
    *   Allows leveraging various foundation models available through Bedrock.
    *   Reduces the need to build and manage complex AI orchestration logic from scratch.
*   **Trade-offs:**
    *   Reliance on Bedrock's specific features and limitations.
    *   Potentially less flexibility compared to building custom agent logic with raw LLM APIs.
    *   Cost implications of Bedrock usage.

## 3. Backend Language & Runtime: Node.js (Serverless First)
*   **Decision:** Use Node.js for backend services (WhatsApp Gateway, Agent Orchestration Service), prioritizing AWS Lambda for deployment.
*   **Justification:**
    *   Node.js is well-suited for I/O-bound operations common in messaging and API orchestration.
    *   Strong AWS SDK support and integration with Lambda.
    *   Serverless (Lambda) approach offers scalability, pay-per-use cost model (good for POC), and reduced operational overhead.
    *   JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem is widely adopted.
    *   Monorepo for POC to simplify initial development.
*   **Trade-offs:**
    *   Lambda has limitations (e.g., execution time, cold starts, though manageable).
    *   If complex, long-running stateful operations are needed, ECS/Fargate might be a better fit eventually, but Lambda is the starting point.

## 4. WhatsApp Integration: Official WhatsApp Business API
*   **Decision:** Integrate directly with the official WhatsApp Business API.
*   **Justification:**
    *   Official and supported method for business messaging on WhatsApp.
    *   Provides necessary features for sending/receiving messages, webhooks, etc.
*   **Trade-offs:**
    *   Requires adherence to WhatsApp policies and API usage guidelines.
    *   Potential costs associated with the WhatsApp Business API.

## 5. Database Strategy: AWS Managed Database (RDS PostgreSQL or DynamoDB)
*   **Decision:** Use an AWS managed database service. The choice between RDS PostgreSQL (relational) and DynamoDB (NoSQL) will be finalized after detailed data modeling for conversation history, agent configurations, and business accounts.
*   **Justification:**
    *   **RDS PostgreSQL:** Good for structured relational data, familiar SQL interface, strong transactional capabilities.
    *   **DynamoDB:** Highly scalable, flexible schema, good for key-value or document-like data (e.g., conversation logs, session state).
    *   Both are managed services, reducing operational burden.
*   **Trade-offs:**
    *   RDS can be more expensive at very small scales if not using serverless options.
    *   DynamoDB requires careful data modeling to optimize query patterns and costs.

## 6. Caching Strategy: Amazon ElastiCache for Redis
*   **Decision:** Implement caching using Amazon ElastiCache for Redis (starting in Phase 2 of POC).
*   **Justification:**
    *   Improve performance by caching frequently accessed data (agent configs, Bedrock responses).
    *   Reduce load on backend services and databases.
    *   Redis is a popular and effective caching solution. ElastiCache is the managed AWS offering.
*   **Trade-offs:**
    *   Adds another component to manage (though managed by AWS).
    *   Introduces considerations for cache invalidation strategies.
    *   Cost of ElastiCache.

## 7. Voice-to-Text: Amazon Transcribe
*   **Decision:** Utilize Amazon Transcribe for converting user voice notes to text.
*   **Justification:**
    *   Managed AWS service specialized for speech-to-text.
    *   Good accuracy and language support.
    *   Integrates well with other AWS services.
*   **Trade-offs:**
    *   Cost of Transcribe usage.
    *   Latency in transcription (though generally acceptable for conversational AI).

## 8. CI/CD: GitHub Actions (Basic for POC)
*   **Decision:** Implement a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for the POC (Phase 4).
*   **Justification:**
    *   Automate build and deployment of Lambda functions.
    *   Integrates directly with GitHub repositories.
    *   Sufficient for POC needs.
*   **Trade-offs:**
    *   More advanced CI/CD features or integration with AWS CodePipeline might be considered post-POC for greater sophistication.

## 9. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Deferred for full implementation post-POC
*   **Decision:** While IaC (e.g., AWS SAM, CDK, CloudFormation) is best practice, full, mature IaC setup will be a post-POC goal. Basic scripts or manual setup might be used for initial POC speed if necessary, with a plan to formalize with IaC.
*   **Justification:**
    *   Speed of initial setup for a tight POC deadline.
    *   Allows for more rapid iteration on infrastructure components during early development.
*   **Trade-offs:**
    *   Risk of configuration drift if not managed carefully.
    *   Manual setup is not easily repeatable or version controlled. This is a recognized technical debt for the POC.

## 10. Security: Foundational AWS Security Practices
*   **Decision:** Implement foundational security using AWS best practices: IAM for least privilege, AWS Secrets Manager for credentials, HTTPS for all external communication, encryption at rest and in transit, basic WAF rules (Phase 3).
*   **Justification:**
    *   Essential for protecting data and system integrity.
    *   Leverages built-in AWS security services.
*   **Trade-offs:**
    *   Comprehensive security (detailed threat modeling, penetration testing, advanced WAF rules, full GDPR automation) is a post-POC effort.

These decisions are based on the current understanding of the project requirements and constraints for the POC. They will be reviewed and potentially revised as the project progresses.
