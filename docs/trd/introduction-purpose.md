# 1.1 Purpose

This Technical Requirements Document (TRD), based on the arc42 template, defines the architecture and implementation details for the WhatsApp Multiagent System. It serves as a comprehensive guide for the technical team developing the Proof of Concept (POC) by the end of September.

The document specifies how the various components will interact to create a scalable multiagent interface on WhatsApp, enabling companies to register their WhatsApp Business accounts and leverage AI agents for natural customer interactions. It incorporates C4 modeling to visualize the system at different levels of abstraction, from high-level context diagrams to detailed component specifications.

This TRD translates the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) into concrete technical specifications, architecture decisions, and implementation guidance.
