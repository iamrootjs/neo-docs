# 6 Solution Strategy

This section outlines the proposed solution strategy for developing the WhatsApp Multiagent System, focusing on the Proof of Concept (POC) deliverables.

## 1. Architectural Approach: Cloud-Native & Agent-Based

*   **Cloud-Native Foundation:** The system will be built entirely on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to leverage its scalability, managed services, and AI capabilities. This aligns with the project's need for a robust and scalable infrastructure.
*   **Agent-Based Architecture:** The core logic will revolve around a multiagent system:
    *   **Supervisor Agent:** Implemented using Amazon Bedrock Agents. Responsible for initial user interaction, intent recognition, context gathering (clarifying questions), and routing to appropriate Domain Agents or tools.
    *   **Domain Agents:** Also implemented using Amazon Bedrock Agents. Each will be specialized for specific business functions (e.g., customer support, sales inquiries) and will utilize its own knowledge base and potentially specific third-party APIs.
    *   **Communication:** Agents will communicate internally, potentially through a defined protocol or orchestrated by the backend application logic.
*   **Backend Services:** A Node.js backend (initially a monorepo) will serve as the primary orchestrator, handling:
    *   Integration with the WhatsApp Business API (receiving webhooks, sending messages).
    *   Managing agent lifecycles and state (session management, conversation history).
    *   Interfacing with AWS services (Bedrock, databases, S3, etc.).
    *   Exposing necessary APIs (e.g., for WhatsApp webhook).

## 2. Key Technology Choices (POC)

*   **Backend Framework:** Node.js (specific framework like Express.js or Fastify to be decided, leaning towards simplicity for POC).
*   **AI Platform:** Amazon Bedrock (Agents, Foundation Models for NLU/NLG).
*   **WhatsApp Integration:** Official WhatsApp Business API.
*   **Database:** An AWS managed database service (e.g., Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL or DynamoDB). Decision to be finalized based on data modeling for conversation history and agent configurations.
*   **Caching:** Amazon ElastiCache for Redis (basic implementation for Phase 2).
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Consideration for AWS CDK or CloudFormation for managing AWS resources, though manual setup might be used for initial POC speed if necessary.
*   **Voice-to-Text:** An appropriate AWS service (e.g., Amazon Transcribe) or a capability within Bedrock/WhatsApp API if available.

## 3. Development and Deployment Strategy (POC)

*   **Phased Development:** Adhering to the PRD timeline, focusing on incremental delivery of features.
*   **Version Control:** Git, with repositories hosted on GitHub.
*   **CI/CD:** Basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployments to a test environment.
*   **Testing:** Focus on unit and integration tests for critical components. Agent accuracy will be tested through defined scenarios.
*   **Documentation:** Vitepress for technical and product documentation.

## 4. Data Management Strategy (POC)

*   **Conversation Logs:** Securely store conversation history for context management and potential future analysis. Data minimization principles will be considered.
*   **Knowledge Bases:** Store and manage knowledge base content, likely in S3 or a structured format accessible by Bedrock Agents.
*   **Credentials:** Securely manage WhatsApp API keys and other sensitive credentials using AWS Secrets Manager.

## 5. Addressing Key Requirements (POC Focus)

*   **Natural Language Interaction:** Leveraged through Bedrock Agents.
*   **Scalability:** Foundational AWS services provide a path to scalability, though the POC will not be load-tested extensively.
*   **Security:** Basic security measures (HTTPS, IAM roles, secure credential storage) will be implemented from the start.

This strategy prioritizes delivering the core POC functionality by the end of September, establishing a solid foundation for future enhancements and scaling.
