# External Interface Requirements

This section details the external interfaces required for the WhatsApp Multiagent System POC, including user interfaces, external APIs, and hardware/software interfaces.

## User Interfaces

For the WhatsApp Multiagent System POC, the primary user interface is WhatsApp itself, which is external to our system. Additionally, basic administrative interfaces may be needed for configuration and monitoring.

| No | User Interface Name | Description | Primary Users |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | WhatsApp Client | The external WhatsApp mobile or web application where end-users interact with our system. This is not part of our development but the primary interface through which users access our agents. | End users |
| 2 | AWS Console | AWS's management console used for configuration, monitoring, and administration of the system components. | Developers, System Administrators |
| 3 | CloudWatch Dashboard | Custom CloudWatch dashboards for monitoring system performance, errors, and usage metrics. | Developers, System Administrators |
| 4 | Basic Admin Dashboard (Optional for POC) | A simple web interface for viewing conversation logs, configuring agents, and managing knowledge bases. May be implemented in minimal form for the POC or deferred to post-POC. | System Administrators |

## External APIs and Services

The system will integrate with the following external APIs and services:

| API/Service | Description | Integration Method | Authentication Method |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WhatsApp Business API | The official API that allows business accounts to programmatically send and receive WhatsApp messages. | Webhook for receiving messages; REST API calls for sending messages | Token-based authentication |
| Amazon Bedrock | AWS's AI service that provides foundation models for natural language processing, including Claude, Anthropic and other models. | AWS SDK | AWS IAM |
| Third-Party API (POC) | At least one domain-specific third-party API relevant to a domain agent's function (e.g., weather service, product catalog). Specific API to be determined during development. | REST API calls | OAuth/API Key (depending on the selected API) |

## Software Interfaces

| Interface Type | Description | Interactions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AWS Lambda | Serverless compute service that runs code in response to events. | Triggered by API Gateway, CloudWatch Events; can invoke other AWS services. |
| Amazon API Gateway | Managed service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST and WebSocket APIs. | Receives WebHook requests from WhatsApp; forwards to Lambda functions. |
| Amazon DynamoDB | NoSQL database service for session management and conversation storage. | Read/write operations from Lambda functions for storing and retrieving conversation data. |
| Amazon S3 | Object storage service for storing knowledge base documents. | Read operations for retrieving documents; write operations for uploading new documents. |
| Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base | Service for creating, querying, and managing knowledge bases for generative AI applications. | Vector search operations from Lambda functions via AWS SDK. |
| Amazon CloudWatch | Monitoring and observability service for metrics, logs, and alarms. | Logging from Lambda functions; metrics collection; alarm triggering. |
| Amazon ElastiCache (Redis) | In-memory data store for caching frequently accessed data. | Read/write operations for session data and response caching. |
| GitHub | Version control and CI/CD platform. | Source code management; automated workflows for build and deployment. |

## Hardware Interfaces

The system is cloud-native and serverless, so direct hardware interfaces are abstracted by AWS services. However, the following hardware-related considerations apply:

| Hardware Consideration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Client Devices | End-users will access the system through their WhatsApp application on smartphones, tablets, or desktop computers. The system must handle responses appropriately for different device types. |
| Lambda Resources | AWS Lambda functions can be configured with different memory allocations, which affects CPU allocation. Appropriate sizing will be determined during development based on performance testing. |
| Network Connectivity | Reliable internet connectivity is required for all system components, with appropriate error handling for network disruptions. |

## Communications Interfaces

| Interface | Description | Protocol | Security |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| External API Communication | Communication between our system and external APIs (WhatsApp Business API, third-party services). | HTTPS | TLS 1.2+, API tokens/keys |
| AWS Service Communication | Communication between AWS services within our architecture. | AWS internal protocols | IAM roles and policies |
| CloudWatch Logging | Transmission of log data from Lambda functions to CloudWatch. | AWS internal protocols | IAM roles and policies |
| GitHub CI/CD | Communication between GitHub and AWS for deployments. | HTTPS | OIDC, IAM roles |

## Data Exchange Formats

| Format | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| JSON | Primary data exchange format for API communications, configuration files, and data storage. |
| AWS CloudFormation/CDK | Infrastructure as code format for AWS resource definitions. |
| Markdown | Documentation format for project documentation. |
| YAML | Configuration files for CI/CD pipelines and certain AWS services. |

The WhatsApp Multiagent System POC will focus on implementing these interfaces in a minimal viable form to demonstrate the core functionality, with plans for enhancement in post-POC phases.
