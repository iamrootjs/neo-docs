# Introduction and Goals

## 1. Introduction

This Technical Requirements Document (TRD) outlines the technical aspects, architecture, and implementation details for the WhatsApp Multiagent System. This project aims to build a scalable multiagent interface on WhatsApp, enabling companies to register their WhatsApp Business accounts and leverage a sophisticated AI-powered platform.

The system will utilize a supervisor agent and domain-specific agents, powered by Amazon Bedrock. These agents will interact with users through natural language, manage conversational flows, access knowledge bases, and integrate with third-party APIs. The core objective is to provide a reliable, secure, and seamless customer engagement experience, moving beyond traditional convoluted menu-driven systems.

This document serves as a guide for the development team, outlining the technical decisions, components, and strategies to achieve the project's objectives, starting with a Proof of Concept (POC) due by the end of September.

## 2. Project Goals (from a Technical Perspective)

The primary technical goals for the WhatsApp Multiagent System are:

*   **TG1: Establish Core Infrastructure:** Implement a robust and scalable backend infrastructure on AWS capable of supporting the WhatsApp integration, agent orchestration, and data management.
*   **TG2: Develop a Modular Multiagent Framework:** Design and build a flexible framework that supports a supervisor agent for routing and multiple domain-specific agents. This includes clear interfaces for agent communication and management.
*   **TG3: Integrate with WhatsApp Business API:** Ensure reliable and secure two-way communication between the system and the WhatsApp platform, handling various message types (text, voice notes).
*   **TG4: Leverage Amazon Bedrock for AI Capabilities:** Effectively utilize Bedrock agents for natural language understanding, task fulfillment, knowledge base querying, and basic API interactions.
*   **TG5: Implement Core Conversational Features:** Enable natural language interaction, context management (session history), voice-to-text conversion, and a mechanism for agents to ask clarifying questions.
*   **TG6: Ensure Data Management and Security:** Implement secure storage for sensitive data (e.g., API keys, business account information) and user conversation logs. Lay the foundation for data privacy compliance (e.g., GDPR).
*   **TG7: POC Delivery:** Successfully deliver a Proof of Concept by the end of September, demonstrating the core functionalities outlined in the PRD scope. This includes:
    *   WhatsApp Business Account registration/connection.
    *   Basic supervisor and domain agent functionality.
    *   Natural language query understanding and basic tool/agent selection.
    *   Voice note to text conversion.
    *   Basic knowledge base integration for one domain agent.
    *   Initial CI/CD pipeline setup.

## 3. Out of Scope for POC (Technical Perspective)

Refer to the PRD `scope.md` for items explicitly out of scope for the initial POC. From a technical standpoint, this means deferring:

*   Complex, multi-turn conversational flows and advanced guardrail systems.
*   Extensive third-party API integrations beyond simple POC needs.
*   Advanced image/document processing and analysis.
*   Full-scale WAF implementation and comprehensive GDPR compliance automation.
*   Optimized, widespread Redis caching.
*   A dedicated user interface for business account configuration.
*   Support for multiple languages beyond English (unless specified for a POC use case).
