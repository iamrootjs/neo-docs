# 12 Design Decisions

This document captures specific design decisions for the WhatsApp Multiagent System POC that complement the higher-level architectural decisions documented separately. These decisions focus on implementation details, technology selections, and design patterns.

| Decision | Rationale | Trade-offs |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Node.js with TypeScript** | Type safety and improved developer experience while maintaining Node.js runtime efficiency for I/O-focused operations. | Slight build time overhead, but benefits in maintainability outweigh this concern. |
| **Monorepo Structure for POC** | Simplifies dependency management and sharing of code between Lambda functions during rapid development. | Less separation of concerns initially, but can be refactored post-POC if needed. |
| **WhatsApp Message Handling Design Pattern** | Implement a middleware-based approach for message processing (authentication → parsing → session management → routing). | More complex than direct processing but provides better separation of concerns and extensibility. |
| **Session Management Strategy** | Use DynamoDB for persistent sessions with TTL feature and Redis caching for active sessions. | Additional complexity in maintaining two storage mechanisms, but improves performance for active conversations. |
| **Agent Prompting Strategy** | Design system prompts with specific sections for: 1) Role/context 2) Capabilities/limitations 3) Response format requirements. | More complex prompt engineering but produces more consistent agent responses. |
| **Error Handling Approach** | Implement graceful degradation for AI components - provide simpler but reliable responses when more sophisticated processing fails. | Requires additional implementation effort but improves overall system reliability. |
| **Knowledge Base Document Structure** | Create standardized JSON schema for metadata of knowledge base documents to improve search relevance. | Initial overhead in document preparation, but better search results and maintenance. |
| **Bedrock Agent Configuration** | Start with two focused domain agents rather than many specialized ones, allowing for better tuning of each during POC. | Less domain coverage but higher quality for covered domains. |
| **Conversation Storage Schema** | Store conversations with metadata that facilitates future analytics (intent categorization, resolution status, domain agent used). | Slightly more complex data model but enables valuable insights post-POC. |
| **Webhook Authentication** | Implement WhatsApp Webhook authentication using a dedicated Lambda function with cached verification tokens. | More complex than inline verification but better separation of concerns. |
| **Message Queue Strategy** | Use SQS for message processing to handle potential rate limits from WhatsApp and Bedrock. | Additional AWS component to manage but provides better resilience. |
| **Logging Strategy** | Implement structured logging with conversation IDs, user IDs (hashed), and request IDs for traceability. | Slightly more complex logging implementation but essential for debugging and monitoring. |
| **Response Generation Pattern** | Two-phase response construction: (1) Intent and knowledge retrieval (2) Response generation with retrieved context. | Additional Bedrock calls but improved response quality and reduced hallucination. |
| **Caching Strategy** | Multi-level caching: Frequent queries (in Redis), API responses (in Redis), Agent responses for common queries (in DynamoDB). | Complexity in cache invalidation management but significant performance improvements. |
| **Voice Note Processing** | Asynchronous processing with a separate Lambda function connected via SQS to avoid timeout issues with long transcriptions. | More complex flow but better handling of variable-length voice notes. |

These design decisions are specific to the POC implementation and may evolve as requirements change or as we learn from the initial implementation. They are intended to provide guidance while allowing flexibility for the development team to make adjustments as needed.
