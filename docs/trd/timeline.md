## Technical Considerations for Future Phases (Post-POC)

* Architecture refinement based on POC learnings
* Transition from serverless-first to hybrid architecture if needed for performance
* Implementation of admin interface for business configuration
* Enhanced monitoring and observability implementation
* Comprehensive security audit and hardening
* Full infrastructure-as-code implementation
* Expanded test automation and QA processes
* Performance optimization and scaling strategy implementation
