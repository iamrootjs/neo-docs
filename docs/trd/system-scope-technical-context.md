# 5.2 Technical Context

The WhatsApp Multiagent System operates within a cloud-native environment, primarily leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS). The key technical components and interactions are as follows:

*   **Core Platform:** AWS will host the backend application logic, AI model interactions, data storage, and API endpoints.
    *   **Compute:** Node.js backend, likely running on AWS Lambda for serverless functions or Amazon EC2/ECS for more sustained workloads. The POC will start with a Monorepo structure for the Node.js application.
    *   **AI Services:** Amazon Bedrock is the central AI service, providing access to foundation models for building the supervisor and domain agents. This includes capabilities for natural language understanding, generation, and function calling (tool use).
    *   **API Gateway:** Amazon API Gateway will manage and expose the necessary HTTP endpoints for the WhatsApp Business API integration and potentially for future administrative interfaces.
    *   **Database:** A persistent data store will be required for storing business account information, agent configurations, conversation logs, and knowledge base metadata. Options include Amazon RDS (e.g., PostgreSQL) or Amazon DynamoDB, chosen based on specific data structure and query needs. (To be finalized for POC, leaning towards a managed AWS DB service).
    *   **Caching:** Amazon ElastiCache for Redis will be used for caching frequently accessed data, API responses, and session information to improve performance and reduce load (Basic implementation in Phase 2).
    *   **Storage:** Amazon S3 will be used for storing larger files, such as documents or images uploaded by users (future phases), and potentially for knowledge base source files.
    *   **Identity & Access Management:** AWS IAM will manage permissions and access control for all AWS resources.
*   **Communication Interface:**
    *   **WhatsApp Business API:** The system will integrate directly with the WhatsApp Business API to send and receive messages. This involves handling webhooks from WhatsApp and making API calls to WhatsApp.
*   **Development & Operations:**
    *   **Version Control:** GitHub will be used for all source code management.
    *   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions will be used to implement basic continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines for the POC (automated build and deploy to test environment).
    *   **Documentation:** Project documentation (including this TRD and the PRD) will be maintained using Vitepress.
*   **External Dependencies (POC):**
    *   WhatsApp Business API.
    *   Amazon Bedrock and other core AWS services.
    *   Potentially simple third-party APIs for specific domain agent functionalities (e.g., a weather API for a demo).

The architecture is designed to be modular, allowing for future expansion and integration of more complex features and services as outlined in the post-POC phases of the project.
