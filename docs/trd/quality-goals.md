# 3 Quality Goals

This section defines the key quality attributes for the WhatsApp Multiagent System, with a focus on what is achievable and measurable for the Proof of Concept (POC) and what are longer-term aspirations. These are derived from the Non-Functional Requirements in the PRD.

| Quality Goal        | Description (POC Focus)                                                                                                | Relevant NFRs (PRD) | How to Measure (POC)                                                                                                | Target (POC)                                                                 | Long-Term Aspiration                                                                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Functionality**   | The system performs the core functions as defined in the POC scope. Agents can understand basic queries, route, and use knowledge bases/tools. | FR sections 1-7       | Scenario-based testing of core features (message send/receive, agent routing, KB query, voice-to-text).             | Successful completion of defined POC test scenarios.                         | Rich, complex conversational flows, extensive tool usage, proactive agent assistance. |
| **Performance**     | The system responds to user interactions in a timely manner for typical POC scenarios.                                   | NFR1.1                | Manual timing of request-response cycles for sample queries. Basic CloudWatch metrics for Lambda/API Gateway.       | Median response time < 3-5 seconds for text queries.                         | Handle X concurrent users with <Y seconds response under load.                           |
| **Reliability**     | Core system components are available and function correctly during testing and demo periods.                             | NFR3.1, NFR3.3        | Monitoring of AWS service status. Successful completion of test scenarios without unexpected system crashes.        | High availability during scheduled test/demo windows. Graceful error handling. | 99.9% uptime for critical components. Automated recovery.                               |
| **Security**        | Sensitive data is handled with basic security measures in place.                                                         | NFR4.1, NFR4.2, NFR4.5 | Review of IAM configurations, secret management, HTTPS usage.                                                       | Secure storage of credentials, HTTPS everywhere, basic IAM least privilege.  | Full WAF, comprehensive GDPR compliance, regular security audits, intrusion detection.  |
| **Scalability**     | The architecture is designed with future scalability in mind, using scalable AWS services.                               | NFR2.1, NFR2.2        | Architectural review. Choice of AWS services (Lambda, Bedrock, managed DBs).                                        | Use of scalable AWS services. Modular design.                                | Horizontal scaling to handle significant load increases. Easy addition of new agents.   |
| **Maintainability** | The codebase for the POC is understandable, organized, and has basic documentation.                                      | NFR6.1, NFR6.2        | Code review for clarity and modularity. Presence of inline comments and basic READMEs for components.               | Well-structured code for POC modules. Basic CI pipeline operational.         | Comprehensive documentation, high test coverage, easy onboarding for new developers.      |
| **Usability (Agent)** | Agents provide relevant and contextually appropriate responses for defined POC test scenarios.                           | NFR8.1                | Qualitative review of agent responses against test scripts.                                                         | Agents provide helpful and accurate responses for core POC use cases.        | High degree of agent accuracy, naturalness, and helpfulness across diverse scenarios.   |
| **Data Management** | User data (conversations) is handled with privacy in mind from the outset.                                               | NFR7.1                | Review of data storage and access patterns.                                                                         | Conversation logs stored securely.                                           | Clear data retention policies, user data anonymization/deletion capabilities.           |

These quality goals will guide design and development decisions throughout the POC phase and will be revisited and expanded for subsequent phases of the project.
