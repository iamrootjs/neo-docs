# 12 Risks and Technical Debts

This section identifies key risks and potential technical debts for the WhatsApp Multiagent System POC, along with proposed mitigation strategies.

## Technical Risks

| Risk | Description | Impact (H/M/L) | Probability (H/M/L) | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Amazon Bedrock Limitations | Bedrock Agents might have capabilities and limitations that affect our implementation, especially for complex agent orchestration and knowledge base integration. | H | M | Start with simplified agent designs. Conduct early proof-of-concept tests specifically for agent interactions. Maintain alternative approaches if specific features prove challenging. |
| WhatsApp Business API Constraints | WhatsApp API might impose rate limits, message format restrictions, or other constraints that impact user experience. | H | M | Research WhatsApp Business API thoroughly. Design with rate limits in mind. Implement queuing mechanisms. Test with realistic message volumes early. |
| Serverless Cold Start Latency | Lambda functions might experience cold starts, causing delays in message processing. | M | H | Implement Lambda provisioned concurrency for critical functions. Design session management to minimize the impact of cold starts. Consider alternate compute models (EC2/ECS) for specific components if latency becomes problematic. |
| Agent Accuracy and Reliability | The agents might provide irrelevant or incorrect responses to user queries. | H | H | Implement comprehensive testing for common query patterns. Design clear error handling and fallback mechanisms. Add logging for agent responses to facilitate improvement. Start with focused domains for domain agents. |
| Session Management Complexity | Maintaining context across a conversation while using serverless architecture could be challenging. | M | M | Carefully design the session management structure with clear TTL policies. Consider using ElastiCache (Redis) for session management if DynamoDB proves inadequate. |
| Integration Complexity | Integrating multiple AWS services, WhatsApp API, and potentially third-party APIs introduces coordination challenges. | M | M | Use well-defined interfaces between components. Implement thorough error handling and logging. Consider AWS Step Functions for complex workflow management. |

## Technical Debts (Planned for POC)

| Technical Debt | Justification | Mitigation/Future Plan |
|----------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Limited Infrastructure as Code (IaC) | For POC speed, some AWS resources may be created manually rather than through comprehensive IaC. | Document all manual resource creation. Plan for full IaC implementation post-POC using AWS CDK or CloudFormation. |
| Basic CI/CD Pipeline | The POC will have a simplified CI/CD pipeline with limited automated testing. | Design the pipeline to be extensible. Plan for comprehensive test automation post-POC. |
| Limited Monitoring | Basic CloudWatch metrics and logs without comprehensive alerting or dashboards. | Establish monitoring foundations with key metrics. Plan for detailed operational dashboards post-POC. |
| Simplified Security Implementation | Basic security measures implemented without comprehensive security testing or hardening. | Adhere to fundamental security principles. Plan for security audit and hardening post-POC. |
| Limited Error Handling | Focus on happy path scenarios with basic error handling for the POC. | Document known error scenarios. Implement robust error handling in critical paths. Plan for comprehensive error handling post-POC. |
| Minimal Documentation | Technical documentation focused on key components rather than comprehensive coverage. | Document core design decisions and APIs. Plan for comprehensive documentation post-POC. |

## Performance Considerations

| Consideration | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|--------|---------------------|
| Bedrock API Latency | Higher response times for complex queries | Implement intelligent caching with Redis. Consider pre-computed responses for common queries. |
| Database Query Performance | Potential bottlenecks with growing conversation history | Design efficient indexes. Implement data archiving strategies for older conversations post-POC. |
| WhatsApp API Throughput | Potential limitations on message volume | Implement queuing mechanisms. Design with rate limits in mind. |
| Overall End-to-End Latency | User experience impact if responses are slow | Optimize each component in the chain. Set clear performance targets and monitor actual performance. |

## Risk Management Strategy

1. **Regular Risk Review**: Weekly assessment of identified risks and emerging issues.
2. **Technical Spikes**: Early investigation of high-risk components (Bedrock Agents, WhatsApp API) before full implementation.
3. **Phased Approach**: Following the phased plan in the PRD to address core functionality before adding complexity.
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of known limitations, workarounds, and future enhancement plans.
5. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and basic monitoring from the start to identify issues early.

The team acknowledges these risks and technical debts as a necessary trade-off to deliver a functional POC by the end of September, with plans to address them in subsequent development phases.
