# Client Interface Layer (WhatsApp & Potential Admin Tools)

The WhatsApp Multiagent System POC does not include a traditional frontend application. Instead, the primary user interface is WhatsApp itself, which is external to our system. For completeness, this document outlines the client interfaces and potential admin tools that may be developed in future phases.

## Primary Client Interface: WhatsApp

For end-users of the WhatsApp Multiagent System:

*   **WhatsApp Mobile/Desktop Application**
    *   This is the primary interface through which users interact with our system.
    *   The WhatsApp application itself is developed and maintained by Meta/WhatsApp, not our system.
    *   Our system interacts with users through the WhatsApp Business API, receiving and sending messages, but has no control over the WhatsApp client interface.
    *   Message types supported include:
        *   Text messages
        *   Voice notes (converted to text by our system)
        *   Basic media (images, documents) - received but with limited processing in the POC

## Optional Admin Interface Components (Minimal for POC or Post-POC)

For the POC, administrative functions will primarily use AWS Console interfaces for monitoring, with minimal custom UI. However, the architecture allows for future development of:

*   **Basic Admin Dashboard (Potential Post-POC)**
    *   **Technology Stack (If Implemented):** Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript, potentially React.js with a lightweight framework
    *   **Potential Components:**
        *   Authentication Module: For secure admin access
        *   Conversation Viewer: View recent conversations between users and agents
        *   Basic Analytics: Simple metrics on usage and agent performance
        *   Agent Configuration Interface: Update prompts or knowledge base connections
        *   System Health Indicators: Status of various services and components

*   **Monitoring Interface (POC)**
    *   For the POC, monitoring will primarily leverage existing AWS services:
        *   AWS CloudWatch dashboards for system metrics
        *   AWS CloudWatch Logs for application logging
        *   AWS Lambda monitoring tools for function performance
        *   Amazon Bedrock console for agent monitoring
        *   Amazon S3 console for knowledge base management

## Front-end Considerations for Future Phases

While the POC focuses on the core backend and AI functionality with WhatsApp as the interface, future phases might include:

*   A comprehensive web-based admin portal for businesses to:
    *   Register and manage WhatsApp Business accounts
    *   Configure and train domain agents
    *   Upload and manage knowledge bases
    *   View detailed analytics and conversation transcripts
    *   Set guardrails and response policies

*   A developer portal for:
    *   API documentation for third-party integrations
    *   Webhook configuration tools
    *   Agent testing and simulation environments

For the POC phase, these frontend components are out of scope, and the focus remains on the WhatsApp interface and backend services.
