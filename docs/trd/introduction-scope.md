# 1.2 Scope

This Technical Requirements Document (TRD) covers the architectural and technical aspects of the WhatsApp Multiagent System Proof of Concept (POC), scheduled for delivery by the end of September.

## System Overview
The WhatsApp Multiagent System is a cloud-native platform built on AWS that enables businesses to provide sophisticated, conversational AI experiences to their customers through WhatsApp. The system uses Amazon Bedrock for AI capabilities, implementing a supervisor agent that routes queries to appropriate domain agents. These agents leverage knowledge bases, third-party APIs, and predefined flows to handle customer inquiries naturally and efficiently.

## Key Technical Areas Covered
- The integration architecture between WhatsApp Business API and AWS services
- The implementation of AI agents using Amazon Bedrock
- Backend services developed in Node.js (monorepo for POC)
- Data storage and management (conversations, knowledge bases, session management)
- Security considerations and implementation
- CI/CD approach using GitHub Actions
- Deployment strategy on AWS (primarily serverless)
- Monitoring and logging using CloudWatch

## Phased Approach
The TRD follows the phased development approach outlined in the PRD:
- Phase 1: Infrastructure and Core Agent Setup
- Phase 2: Knowledge Base, Basic API Integration, and Caching
- Phase 3: Security Foundations, GDPR Considerations, and Agent Accuracy Testing
- Phase 4: CI/CD Setup, Pilot Prep, and Monitoring

This document prioritizes the POC requirements while indicating how the architecture can evolve in future phases.
